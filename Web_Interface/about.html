                This predictive tool is a result of the collaborative efforts of the UBC Master of Data Science - Computational Linguistics program, the UBC Peter A. Allard School of Law, Legal Hackers Ontario - University of Toronto Law chapter, and the Future of Law Lab at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law.

                Through the analysis of over 40,000 unique legal cases at the Ontario Landlord & Tenant Board Tribunal, this tool attempts to predict the likelihood that any given residential tenancy case will result in a notice of eviction. By isolating a variety of individual factors, the tool provides a prediction as to the likelihood that the tenant will be evicted. 
                <br>

                Please be advised that this tool does not constitute legal advice and that the results may not be correct in every scenario. The predictive tool should not be relied upon as a substitute for legal services. Instead, the tool is meant to be used as an additional source of information that may support the decision-making of individuals involved in residential tenancy cases.

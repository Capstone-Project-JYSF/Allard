The project aims to create a system that can provide brief information about the winning prediction on Residential Tenancy related issue in Ontario by analyzing 44,228 cases to understand why judges allow or deny eviction orders in Ontario's Residential Tenancy Board (RTB) under the current legislation. This is a fascinating and socially significant, since it helps thousands of people who are considering whether to launch the suit or not due to financial related problems. Additionally, the current legislation's ambiguity makes it difficult for legal practitioners and academics to predict or understand the reasoning behind certain decisions. By gaining insights into the factors influencing judges' decisions, this project would not only revolutionize access to justice in Ontario, but also show the possible combination of computer science and law.  The primary goal of the project is to create a data-driven report, with the possibility of developing an app, API, or dashboard to provide accessible insights and improve access to justice for those facing eviction.
